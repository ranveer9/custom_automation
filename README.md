# Custom News Scraper

This project is a custom web scraper written in Python that fetches the top local news headlines from a specific website and sends them to your email daily.

## Features

*   Scrapes the top news headlines and their links from a specified local news website.
*   Formats the headlines into an HTML email.
*   Sends the email using SMTP.
*   Automated to run daily using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `python-dotenv`.)*

## Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual email credentials:

    ```dotenv
    EMAIL_SENDER="your_email@gmail.com"
    APP_PASSWORD="your_app_password"
    EMAIL_RECEIVER="recipient_email@example.com"
    ```

    *   **`EMAIL_SENDER`**: The email address you will use to send the news updates.
    *   **`APP_PASSWORD`**: An app password generated for your sending email account (required if you have 2-factor authentication enabled, which is highly recommended). See [Google Account Help](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for generating app passwords.
    *   **`EMAIL_RECEIVER`**: The email address where you want to receive the news updates.

## Usage

To run the script manually:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

*(Note: Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script file, e.g., `scraper.py`)*

## Automation

The script is set up to run daily using GitHub Actions. The workflow file (presumably in `.github/workflows/`) is configured to execute the `job()` function in your Python script at a specified time each day.

## File Structure

The project should typically have a structure similar to this:
/
├── .env
├── your_script_name.py
├── requirements.txt
└── .github/
└── workflows/
└── your_workflow_file.yml


Replace `your_script_name.py` and `your_workflow_file.yml` with your actual file names.
